//Purpose
//In this lab, you will implement a C++ class in separate headerand source files.
//
//What to Do
//Do as many of the following steps as you can.When you complete a step, get it checked off.
//
//REQUIRED
//
//Download file student_main.cpp.
//
//This file will not compile.Without modifying student_main.cpp, get the file to compile by adding files student.hpp& student.cpp to the project.These new files—which you write—should contain the definition of class Student, including all necessary member functions.
//
//In this step, do only the minimum required to get the program to compile.
//
//ADDITIONAL
//
//Add code to class Student to make it do something reasonable, based on the comments in student_main.cpp.
//
//At least one member function must be defined in the source file(student.cpp).
